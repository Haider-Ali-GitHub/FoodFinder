# BiteBuddy
BiteBuddy is a website that is meant to be used as a tool to find a place to eat.
The user wil be given the option to answer a series of questions or be given resturants
at random until the user has found somewhere to eat. The questions consider distance, price,
cuisine, and dining options.
